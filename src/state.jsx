        `Art educator turned software developer. As an educator I direct the MFA Studio Art program where I mentor students through an intensive two-year process from conceptualization, through development and to thesis exhibition with printed monographs. I also co-authored the rewrite for the Art and Design Department’s degrees. The new degrees integrate art/design-focused digital technologies to update the curriculum, resulting in a relevant and competitive program to benefit students entering the creative workforce today. This rewriting process revealed the exciting potential for creative problem solving in software development, which brought me to javascript development and Fullstack Academy.`,
